Ansitape reads, writes, and creates magtapes conforming to the ANSI and IBM standard for magtape labelling. Primarily, this is useful to exchange tapes with VMS and IBM systems, which make this kind of tape by default.

Ansitape was originally written by David S. Hayes, Site Manager, US Army Artificial Intelligence Center and was submitted to comp.sources.unix in August 1986.

Kern Sibbald from the Bacula project corrected a Y2K bug, and edited it to compile on Linux in 2004, and the SNA gang did some cleanup and packaging. this version is derived from the results of that.

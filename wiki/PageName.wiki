     Note to Systems Programmers:
           ansitape uses a boolean function  (eot)  to  determine
           when  the  tape  drive has hit the end of file.  It is
           called every time a block of data is  written  to  the
           tape.   If  this function ever returns TRUE (a defined
           constant), an automatic  volume  switch  occurs.   The
           pertinent  device registers are obtained by a MTIOCGET
           ioctl system call.  The  registers  are  described  in
           /sys/sundev/tmreg.h  (Sun  system with TapeMaster con-
           troller).  If you have a VAX,  the  filename  will  be
           slightly  different.   Sun  Microsystems supplies this
           file even with binary-only distributions.
